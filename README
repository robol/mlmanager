mlmanager is a python module that can be used to manage downloads
of mldonkey.

Once installed, you can easily write script similar to "example_script.py", 
save them in a know location, make them executable and then say mldonkey
to execute them after the download completion.

To configure mldonkey you need to log in in the console, i.e.

  $ telnet localhost 4000
  $ auth admin password

and then to configure the variable file_completed_cmd properly and quit

  $ set file_completed_cmd "/path/to/the/script"
  $ quit

Now mldonkey will call you script after every download. The documentation
of the module can be obtained via a python shell with

  $ python
  >>> import mlmanager
  >>> help(mlmanager)

This is the best way to know what the script can and can't do. But you can also
read the rest of this file. There could be options not listed here!

1) Internal variables

  There are some variables set in the mlmanager module that you should
  change whene you import it. For example

  - mlmanager.domain 

      This is the domain the server is in. It's not very important, but you should
      set it to a correct value

  - mlmanager.from_addr

      This is the addr the mail from the script will come. It's not supposed to be 
      a real email address (even if it can be), but it should be a possible mail_from
      value for your mailserver, otherwise email will not be sent

  - mlmanager.mail_server [ default = 'localhost' ]

      The mail server the script will connect to. It should allow the script to send
      mail without authentication (i.e. it should be the local mail server, or a mail
      server serving the local net)

2) Write your script

  Look at example_script.py for an overview of the possible test that you can do on
  the downloaded file.
